Vite.js is a modern development tool designed to make your React (or any front-end) development faster and easier. Here’s a simplified explanation:

### Why Do We Need Vite?

In the traditional way of developing React apps (like using Create React App), the tool bundles all your code and dependencies together, which can slow down the process, especially as your project grows. This can make starting the development server and updating changes slower.

**Vite** solves this problem by doing things differently:

### What Makes Vite Fast?

1. **Instant Start**: 
   - Vite doesn’t bundle your entire project during development. Instead, it directly serves your JavaScript files as ES modules (which modern browsers understand). This means you can start the development server almost instantly, even for large projects.

2. **Faster Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**:
   - When you make a change in your code, Vite doesn’t rebuild the whole app. It only updates the specific part that you changed. This gives you near-instant updates in your browser while you’re coding.

### How Does It Work?

1. **Development Mode**: Vite takes advantage of the browser's built-in ability to understand modern JavaScript (ES modules), so it doesn’t need to do heavy bundling while you're developing.
   
2. **Production Build**: When you’re ready to deploy, Vite uses a tool called **Rollup** to bundle your app into an optimized package for production, ensuring fast loading times for your users.

### How to Use Vite with React?

1. **Install Vite**:
   You can create a new React project using Vite like this:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react
   ```
   
2. **Start Developing**:
   Inside the project folder, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Vite will start a fast development server, and you can start coding like usual.

### In Summary:
- **Vite** speeds up React development by skipping unnecessary bundling in development and updating your app faster when you make changes.
- It’s ideal for large or small projects, offering a smoother and quicker development experience compared to older tools like Webpack.

If you’re used to Create React App, Vite is like an upgrade that makes everything faster and simpler.

### Adding Bootstrap to a React Application Using NPM

**Hi everyone,**

Welcome back! In this session, we'll learn how to add **Bootstrap** to a React application using **NPM**.

Bootstrap is a **CSS framework** that helps create responsive and well-styled web applications quickly.

### Steps to Install Bootstrap:

1. **Install Bootstrap with NPM**:
   - First, we need to install Bootstrap into our React project using the NPM command.
   - Open your project in **Visual Studio Code**.
   - Open a new terminal by clicking the **plus icon**.
   - Navigate to your project directory:
     ```bash
     cd EMS-frontend
     ```
   - Install Bootstrap by running the following command:
     ```bash
     npm install bootstrap --save
     ```
     - The `--save` option ensures that the dependency gets added to your `package.json` file automatically.
   - Once you hit **Enter**, NPM will install Bootstrap, and you should see a message that Bootstrap has been installed successfully, with the version number (e.g., 5.3.0).

2. **Verify Bootstrap Installation**:
   - To confirm, go to your `**package.json**` file.
   - Under the **dependencies** section, you’ll see:
     ```json
     "bootstrap": "^5.3.0"
     ```
   - This confirms that Bootstrap has been added to your project.

3. **Import Bootstrap CSS File**:
   - Now, we need to import the Bootstrap CSS file to use its styling in our React components.
   - Navigate to the **node_modules** folder and find the **bootstrap** folder.
   - Inside, go to `dist/css` and locate the **bootstrap.min.css** file.
   - Import this file into your `**main.jsx**` (or `index.js`, depending on your project) as follows:
     ```javascript
     import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
     ```

4. **Use Bootstrap Classes**:
   - Let’s test Bootstrap by using one of its CSS classes, such as `text-center`, to center some text.
   - Open the `**HelloWorld.jsx**` file and add a **Bootstrap class** to the `<h1>` tag.
     ```jsx
     <h1 className="text-center">Hello World</h1>
     ```
   - Save the file.

5. **Check in the Browser**:
   - After saving, go to your browser where the application is running, and you should see the "Hello World" heading centered on the page. This confirms that Bootstrap is working.

### Recap of What We Did:

- We installed Bootstrap using:
  ```bash
  npm install bootstrap --save
  ```
- We imported the **bootstrap.min.css** file in the `**main.jsx**` file.
- Finally, we used the `**text-center**` Bootstrap class to center our "Hello World" heading in the browser.

Now that Bootstrap is working, we can start styling our React components using Bootstrap classes in future lessons!

In the next lecture, we'll begin implementing the **list employee** feature.

The **Axios** library is a popular, promise-based HTTP client that is used to make requests from the browser (or Node.js) to external APIs or back-end services. It simplifies sending asynchronous HTTP requests and handling responses, especially when working with **RESTful APIs** in web applications.

### Why Do We Use Axios?

1. **Ease of Use**:
   - Axios provides a simple and clean way to make HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) compared to the native `fetch()` API or XMLHttpRequest.
   - It automatically transforms JSON data into JavaScript objects when receiving responses, reducing the need for manual parsing.

2. **Promise-Based**:
   - Axios is based on JavaScript promises, which makes it easier to work with asynchronous code. You can handle requests and responses using `.then()` and `.catch()`, or even better, with `async/await` syntax.

3. **Handling Responses**:
   - Axios automatically detects the response type (e.g., JSON, Blob, etc.) and provides a clean API to work with the response data.
   - It provides built-in error handling through HTTP status codes, making error handling easier.

4. **Headers and Authentication**:
   - You can easily configure headers for requests, including authentication tokens (like JWTs) and content types, which are often needed in RESTful services.

5. **Interceptors**:
   - Axios allows you to set **interceptors** that can modify requests or responses before they are handled by your code. This is useful for logging, handling global errors, or attaching authentication tokens to every request.

### How Does Axios Work?

Axios is used to make HTTP requests to APIs. The most common HTTP methods are:
- **GET**: Retrieve data from a server.
- **POST**: Send data to a server (e.g., to create or update resources).
- **PUT**: Update data on a server.
- **DELETE**: Remove data from a server.

### Example Usage

#### 1. **GET Request**
Let’s say we want to get a list of users from a server.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);  // Logs the data from the API
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  });
```

#### 2. **POST Request**
Let’s say we want to send data to an API to create a new user.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const newUser = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
};

axios.post('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users', newUser)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('User created:', response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error creating user:', error);
  });
```

#### 3. **Using `async/await`**
You can also use `async/await` to make the code cleaner.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

async function fetchUsers() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  }
}

fetchUsers();
```

### Features of Axios:

1. **Automatic JSON Data Handling**: Axios converts data to JSON format automatically when sending and receiving HTTP requests.
   
2. **Error Handling**: It makes handling errors easier, especially based on HTTP status codes (e.g., 404, 500).

3. **Interceptors**: You can intercept requests or responses and add common logic (e.g., attaching an authorization token to every request).

4. **Supports Canceling Requests**: Axios allows canceling HTTP requests using `CancelToken`, which can be useful when handling search queries or long-running processes.

5. **Built-in Protection Against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: You can configure Axios to automatically handle CSRF tokens, improving security.

### Conclusion:

- **Axios** is a powerful and user-friendly library for handling HTTP requests in web development, commonly used in full-stack applications where the front-end (e.g., React) communicates with back-end APIs (e.g., built with Spring Boot).
- It simplifies code, handles responses gracefully, and integrates easily with front-end frameworks, making it an essential tool for developers.

The `@CrossOrigin(*)` annotation in Spring Boot is used to enable **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** for specific endpoints or the entire controller in a Spring Boot application. It allows your back-end API (which is typically hosted on one domain) to accept requests from a different domain (such as your front-end React application), enabling communication between them.

### Why is `@CrossOrigin(*)` Used?

When you're building a full-stack application where the **frontend (React)** and the **backend (Spring Boot)** are hosted on different domains (or different ports on the same domain), the **browser’s same-origin policy** prevents the frontend from making HTTP requests to the backend due to **CORS restrictions**.

For example:
- Frontend running on: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API running on: `http://localhost:8080`

These are considered **different origins** because they have different ports, even though the domain (localhost) is the same.

Without enabling **CORS**, the browser will block such requests for security reasons.

### What Does `@CrossOrigin("*")` Do?

The `@CrossOrigin("*")` annotation tells Spring Boot to allow cross-origin requests from any domain (`*` means "allow all origins") to your back-end API.

Here’s how it works:
- When a request is made from your frontend (e.g., running on `localhost:3000`) to the backend API (running on `localhost:8080`), the browser first sends an **OPTIONS request** (a preflight request) to check if the backend allows requests from the frontend domain.
- If CORS is enabled on the backend using `@CrossOrigin`, the server responds with appropriate headers indicating that the request is allowed.

#### Example of Using `@CrossOrigin` in a Controller

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.CrossOrigin;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
@CrossOrigin("*")  // Allow requests from all origins
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/api/data")
    public String getData() {
        return "This is data from the backend!";
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `@CrossOrigin("*")` annotation allows any frontend (any domain or origin) to access the `/api/data` endpoint.
- This is useful for local development when your frontend and backend are running on different ports, or when your frontend is hosted on a different domain than the backend.

### Alternative Usage (Restricting Origins)

You can also configure the `@CrossOrigin` annotation to allow only specific origins (for security purposes), like this:

```java
@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:3000")  // Allow requests only from localhost:3000
public class MyController {
    // Controller methods
}
```

### Important Points:
1. **Security Considerations**: While `@CrossOrigin("*")` allows requests from all domains, it is generally safer to restrict CORS to specific domains (like your frontend domain) to prevent misuse by malicious sites.
   
2. **Preflight Requests**: The browser sends a **preflight OPTIONS request** before making the actual request. The backend must respond with proper CORS headers (like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) to indicate that the frontend is allowed to make the request.

3. **Global CORS Configuration**: If you need to configure CORS globally for all controllers, you can set it up in the `WebMvcConfigurer` class without adding `@CrossOrigin` on each controller.

### Conclusion:

- The `@CrossOrigin("*")` annotation is essential for enabling communication between a frontend and backend hosted on different domains or ports.
- It relaxes the browser’s security policy to allow requests from external origins, but should be configured carefully in production environments for security reasons.

The `react-router-dom` library is used in React applications to manage and navigate between different views or pages. It is one of the most commonly used libraries for **client-side routing** in React. It enables React developers to create **single-page applications (SPAs)** where users can navigate between different components or views without needing a full page reload.

### Why We Use `react-router-dom`:
1. **Single Page Application (SPA) Navigation**:
   - In traditional web applications, navigating between pages usually involves full page reloads. This slows down the user experience.
   - React applications, being single-page apps, load a single HTML file. Instead of reloading the entire page, React can dynamically update parts of the page as the user navigates.
   - `react-router-dom` enables seamless navigation within an SPA by updating the URL without refreshing the page.

2. **Declarative Routing**:
   - With `react-router-dom`, you can define routes declaratively in your JSX code. This makes it easy to map different URLs to specific components or views in your application.
   
3. **Dynamic Routing**:
   - React Router allows for dynamic route matching. You can define routes that include parameters and variables, which makes it easy to display data or components based on the current URL.
   
4. **Browser and Hash History Support**:
   - `react-router-dom` provides two primary methods for managing browser history:
     - **BrowserRouter**: Uses HTML5 history API (pushState, replaceState) for clean URLs (e.g., `/about`).
     - **HashRouter**: Uses the URL hash (e.g., `/#/about`), which is useful for applications hosted on servers that don’t support clean URL routing.
   
5. **Nested Routing**:
   - React Router allows routes to be nested, meaning you can structure your application to have parent and child routes. This is particularly useful for complex applications with multiple layers of views.

6. **Route Protection (Private Routes)**:
   - You can use `react-router-dom` to implement **protected routes**, meaning certain routes can be accessible only when a user is authenticated. If the user is not authenticated, you can redirect them to a login page.

### How It Works:

In `react-router-dom`, you define a set of routes that map URLs to specific components. Here’s a basic example:

1. **Installing `react-router-dom`**:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

2. **Basic Example**:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function Home() {
  return <h2>Home Page</h2>;
}

function About() {
  return <h2>About Page</h2>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link> | <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </nav>
      
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Router**: The `BrowserRouter` component wraps the entire application, providing routing capabilities.
   
2. **Link**: The `Link` component is used to navigate between routes without refreshing the page, unlike traditional anchor tags (`<a>`).

3. **Routes**: The `Routes` component is used to define the different routes in your application.

4. **Route**: Each `Route` specifies a path and the corresponding component to render when the path is matched (e.g., `/about` renders the `About` component).

5. **Dynamic Route Parameters**: You can define dynamic routes like this:

```jsx
<Route path="/user/:id" element={<UserProfile />} />
```
In this case, the `:id` part of the URL is a dynamic parameter that you can access within the `UserProfile` component using `useParams()`.

### Key Features of `react-router-dom`:
- **Route-based navigation**: Navigate between different views based on the current URL.
- **Programmatic navigation**: Redirect users or navigate programmatically using `useNavigate()`.
- **Route parameters**: Handle dynamic URLs by using parameters (e.g., `/user/:id`).
- **Nested routes**: Organize routes hierarchically for complex applications.
- **Protected routes**: Set up access control based on user authentication.

### Why It's Important:
- **Improves User Experience**: React Router allows for fast, smooth navigation in single-page applications without page reloads.
- **Keeps UI in Sync with URL**: The URL reflects the current view, making it easier to bookmark, share, and navigate.
- **Encourages Modular Code**: By routing different components based on the URL, it helps organize and modularize your application's code.
