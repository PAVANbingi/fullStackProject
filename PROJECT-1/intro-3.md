### **Three-Layer Architecture in a Spring Boot Application**

**Welcome back!**

In today’s lecture, we’ll explore the **three-layer architecture** used in **Spring Boot applications**. This architecture pattern helps organize the codebase, making it modular, maintainable, and scalable.

---

### **What is the Three-Layer Architecture?**

The **three-layer architecture** is a widely adopted pattern in Spring Boot applications. It divides the application into three distinct layers, each with a specific role:

1. **Presentation Layer (Controller Layer or Web Layer)**  
2. **Service Layer**  
3. **Data Access Layer (Persistence Layer or Repository Layer)**  

Each layer has its own responsibilities, promoting **separation of concerns**.

---

### **The Three Layers in Detail**

1. **Presentation Layer (Controller Layer)**:
   - **Role**: The presentation layer is responsible for handling **user requests**. It processes incoming **HTTP requests**, prepares the **response**, and sends it back to the client (e.g., web browser, mobile app, Postman).
   - **Implementation**: In Spring Boot, the presentation layer is implemented using **Spring MVC controllers**, which are annotated with `@Controller` or `@RestController`.
   
   Example:
   ```java
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/api/employees")
   public class EmployeeController {
       // Handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.)
   }
   ```
   
   The controller’s job is to manage the request-response lifecycle.

2. **Service Layer**:
   - **Role**: This layer contains the **business logic** of the application. The service layer handles data manipulation, business rules, and communication between the controller and the repository layers.
   - **Implementation**: In Spring Boot, services are implemented using **Spring-managed beans** annotated with `@Service`.

   Example:
   ```java
   @Service
   public class EmployeeService {
       // Business logic
   }
   ```

   The service layer processes the data and returns the necessary information to the controller.

3. **Data Access Layer (Repository Layer)**:
   - **Role**: This layer interacts directly with the **database**. It performs **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and communicates with the persistence layer, managing database entities.
   - **Implementation**: In Spring Boot, this layer is implemented using **Spring Data JPA repositories** annotated with `@Repository`.

   Example:
   ```java
   @Repository
   public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {
       // Database operations
   }
   ```

   The repository handles database communication, abstracting the data operations away from the business logic.

---

### **Package Structure for Three-Layer Architecture**

When building a Spring Boot application, we organize the codebase into separate **packages** based on the three-layer architecture. Here’s a typical packaging structure:

1. **`controller` package**:
   - Contains all **Spring MVC controllers** that manage HTTP requests.
   
   Example: `com.example.app.controller.EmployeeController`

2. **`service` package**:
   - Contains the **business logic** interfaces and classes, managed by Spring.

   Example: `com.example.app.service.EmployeeService`

3. **`repository` package**:
   - Contains **Spring Data JPA repositories** for interacting with the database.

   Example: `com.example.app.repository.EmployeeRepository`

This package structure ensures that each layer’s responsibilities are well-separated, improving maintainability and scalability.

---

### **Conclusion**

To summarize, in a **Spring Boot application**, the **three-layer architecture** is an essential design pattern for organizing the codebase. It divides the application into:
- **Presentation layer** (controller layer),
- **Service layer**, and
- **Data access layer** (repository layer).

Each layer is responsible for a specific part of the application's workflow, ensuring modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

In the **next lecture**, we will see how to implement this architecture by creating a Spring Boot application and structuring it based on the three-layer design.

Here’s a refined version of your explanation for integrating the **Lombok library** and generating a Spring Boot project:

---

### **Using Lombok to Reduce Boilerplate Code in a Spring Boot Application**

In this part of the lecture, we are going to integrate the **Lombok library** to help reduce boilerplate code, such as writing **getter** and **setter** methods, **constructors**, and other repetitive tasks that we typically have to write manually.

---

### **Step 1: Adding Lombok Dependency**

1. In your **Spring Boot project**, navigate to the **pom.xml** file.  
2. To include **Lombok**, we will add the **Lombok annotation library**. Lombok simplifies the code by auto-generating the getter, setter, and constructor methods.

Here’s the **Lombok dependency** you need to add in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
    <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
    <version>1.18.24</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

This library helps reduce the need for boilerplate code in your model classes.

---

### **Step 2: Review Dependencies in pom.xml**

Once Lombok is added, review your project’s **pom.xml** file to confirm the dependencies. The key dependencies should include:

1. **Spring Boot Starter Web**: For building web applications.
2. **Spring Boot Starter Data JPA**: To handle JPA operations with ease.
3. **MySQL JDBC Driver**: To connect to the MySQL database.
4. **Lombok**: To simplify code with annotations.
5. **Spring Boot Starter Test**: For unit and integration testing.

Your `pom.xml` should now include all these dependencies, ensuring the project is ready for development.

---

### **Step 3: Exploring the Project Structure**

If you want to explore the project structure:

- Click on the **"Explore"** button within your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ or Eclipse) to view the different packages, files, and the **pom.xml**.
- You should see folders like `src/main/java` and `src/main/resources` where you’ll place your application code and configuration files.

Within **`src/main/java`**, you’ll find the main application package, where you can start building your business logic.

---

### **Step 4: Generate the Spring Boot Project**

Once you’re satisfied with the dependencies and project setup:

1. Click the **"Generate"** button to generate the Spring Boot application as a **zip file**.
2. This will download the zip file onto your file system.
3. **Unzip** the file and open it in your IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.).

---

### **Conclusion**

By integrating the **Lombok library**, we’ve significantly reduced the need for boilerplate code in our application. In upcoming sections, we’ll explore how Lombok annotations like `@Getter`, `@Setter`, and `@AllArgsConstructor` can be used to simplify your code even further.

Let’s move ahead and continue developing our Spring Boot application!

Here’s a breakdown of the key dependencies in a **Spring Boot application**, including **Spring Web**, **Spring Data JPA**, **MySQL JDBC Driver**, and **Lombok**:

---

### 1. **Spring Web**

**Spring Web** is a core component of the **Spring Framework** that provides tools for building web-based applications, especially RESTful services. In a Spring Boot project, the **Spring Web Starter** is essential for creating and handling HTTP requests, responses, and handling APIs.

#### Key Features:
- **Spring MVC**: Provides the Model-View-Controller architecture to create web applications.
- **RESTful APIs**: Simplifies building REST APIs for interacting with clients (like Postman, mobile apps, web browsers).
- **Embedded Web Server**: By default, Spring Boot applications include an embedded **Tomcat** server, so there’s no need to deploy your application on an external server.

#### Maven Dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

---

### 2. **Spring Data JPA**

**Spring Data JPA** simplifies database access by reducing boilerplate code, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic rather than complex data access code. It is built on top of **Java Persistence API (JPA)**, an API for managing relational data.

#### Key Features:
- **Automatic CRUD**: Provides pre-built methods like `save()`, `findAll()`, `findById()`, `delete()`, and more, reducing the need for writing queries manually.
- **JPA Repositories**: With the use of the `@Repository` annotation, you can interface with the database effortlessly.
- **Query Methods**: Automatically generates SQL queries based on method names like `findByName` or `findByAgeGreaterThan`.
- **Hibernate**: Often, Spring Data JPA is used with Hibernate, a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool.

#### Maven Dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

---

### 3. **MySQL JDBC Driver**

To interact with a **MySQL database**, Spring Boot needs a **JDBC driver**. The MySQL JDBC Driver enables Java applications to connect to MySQL databases by handling the database communication and converting Java objects to SQL queries.

#### Key Features:
- **Database Connectivity**: Allows your Spring Boot application to connect to a MySQL database.
- **JDBC Implementation**: It is a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver, following the JDBC API to perform database operations.
- **Connection Pooling**: Integrates with Spring Boot’s default connection pooling for efficient database connections.

#### Maven Dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

---

### 4. **Lombok**

**Lombok** is a Java library that helps eliminate repetitive and boilerplate code by generating common methods such as **getters**, **setters**, **toString()**, and constructors through annotations. This simplifies the code and enhances readability.

#### Key Features:
- **`@Getter` and `@Setter`**: Automatically generates getter and setter methods for class fields.
- **`@ToString`**: Generates a `toString()` method that includes all class fields.
- **`@NoArgsConstructor` and `@AllArgsConstructor`**: Automatically generates constructors with no arguments or with arguments for all fields.
- **`@Data`**: A shorthand annotation that combines `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@ToString`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, and `@RequiredArgsConstructor`.

#### Example of Lombok in action:
```java
@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Employee {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String department;
}
```

This code is equivalent to writing all the getter, setter, constructors, and `toString()` manually, but Lombok makes it more concise.

#### Maven Dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
    <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
    <version>1.18.24</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

**Vite.js** is a fast and modern build tool for web development. It aims to provide an improved development experience by offering instant server start, lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR), and optimized production builds. Created by the same developer behind Vue.js (Evan You), Vite is framework-agnostic, meaning it can be used with multiple JavaScript frameworks, like React, Vue, and even plain JavaScript projects.

Here’s a breakdown of Vite.js:

### Key Features:
1. **Instant Dev Server Start**:
   - Vite uses native ES modules, so the browser can handle imports directly. This allows Vite to start the development server almost instantly, even for large projects.

2. **Fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**:
   - Unlike traditional bundlers that re-bundle the whole application on file changes, Vite only rebuilds the module that has changed, significantly speeding up the development process.

3. **Optimized Production Build**:
   - For production, Vite uses **Rollup** under the hood to bundle your code, ensuring optimized and efficient builds.

4. **Out-of-the-Box Support**:
   - Vite supports many front-end frameworks and libraries out of the box, such as React, Vue, and Svelte, with minimal configuration.

5. **Modern JavaScript Support**:
   - Vite takes advantage of modern browser features like ES modules and dynamic imports to provide a modern development experience. This removes the need for heavy transpiling during development.

6. **Plugin Ecosystem**:
   - Vite has a rich plugin ecosystem that extends its functionality. Popular plugins include support for TypeScript, JSX/TSX, and various CSS pre-processors like Sass and Tailwind CSS.

### How Vite Works:
- **Development Mode**: During development, Vite serves your source files as native ES modules, which the browser loads directly. Changes are reflected instantly due to HMR.
- **Production Mode**: When building for production, Vite bundles the application using Rollup, which reduces the size of the final output and ensures compatibility across all modern browsers.

### Why Use Vite?
- **Speed**: It’s much faster than traditional bundlers like Webpack, especially for large projects, due to its ES module-based approach.
- **Minimal Configuration**: Vite comes with sensible defaults, allowing developers to start projects quickly without spending a lot of time on configuration.
- **Optimized Build**: Rollup is well-known for producing highly optimized and small production bundles, which Vite leverages.

### Example Use Case:
In a **React project**, you can use Vite to handle the build process. Instead of using Webpack or create-react-app, Vite simplifies the setup and speeds up both the development and production phases.

### Getting Started with Vite:
To create a new project with Vite:
1. **Install Vite**: 
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-app --template react
   ```
   (or with other templates like Vue or vanilla JS)

2. **Start Development**:
   ```bash
   cd my-app
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

This will set up a development server instantly, and you can start coding your React application with fast hot reloads and minimal configuration. 

In summary, **Vite** is a modern build tool designed for speed and simplicity in development, making it a great choice for building modern front-end applications.
